In this work, we have studied ... Say briefly the importance of fixed epsilon.

Briefly describe the results obtained.

For future work, we consider the following directions.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The case of multiple followers
    \item other kinds of quantitative objectives like discounted sum, quantitative reachability for ASV-$\epsilon$.
    \item other forms of solution concepts like subgame perfect equilibrium instead of Nash equilibrium as has been considered here; one can also study both CSV and ASV for SPEs.
    \item A more realistic scenario would be to consider several leaders who are in an equilibrium (like Nash), and each leader has several followers.
\end{enumerate}
