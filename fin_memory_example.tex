\begin{proof}
Consider the example in Figure \ref{fig:finite_strategy_response}. We show that $\mathbf{ASV}^{\epsilon}(v_0) = 1 - \epsilon$. Assume a strategy $\sigma_0^{k}$ for Player 0 defined as: repeat forever, from $v_1$ play one time $v_1 \to v_1$ and then repeat playing $v_1 \to v_0$ for $k$ times, with $k$ chosen such that mean-payoff for Player 0 is equal to $1 - \epsilon$. Such a $k$ always exists. The $\epsilon$-best response of Player 1 to $\sigma_0^{k}$ is to always play $v_0 \to v_1$, as by playing this edge forever, Player 1 gets a mean-payoff equal to $1+\epsilon$, where as if Player 1 plays $v_0 \to v_2$, then Player 1 is receives a payoff of $1$. Since $1 \ngtr (1 + \epsilon) - \epsilon$, the strategy $v_0 \to v_2$ does not fall under the $\epsilon$-best-response for Player 1, thus forcing Player 1 to play $v_0 \to v_1$. Thus $\mathbf{ASV}^{\epsilon}(v_0)$ is achieved with a finite memory of size $k$ for Player 0. Note that this size $k$ is a function of $\epsilon$.
