In this \mychapter, we study the threshold problem of determining if $\mathbf{ASV}^{\epsilon}(v) > c$  for a given game $\mathcal{G}$ where $v$ is a vertex in $\mathcal{G}$ and $c$ is some rational constant.

We start by showing that if $\mathbf{ASV}^{\epsilon}(v) > c$, then there exists a strategy $\sigma_0$ for Player~0 that enforces $\mathbf{ASV}^{\epsilon}(\sigma_0)(v) > c$.

\noindent\textbf{Witnesses for $\mathbf{ASV}^{\epsilon}$} For a mean-payoff game $\mathcal{G}$ and an $\epsilon > 0$, we associate with each vertex $v$ in $\mathcal{G}$, the following set of pairs of real numbers:
\begin{equation*}
\Lambda^{\epsilon}(v) = \{(c,d) \in \mathbb{R}^2 \mid v \models \ll 1 \gg \underline{\mathbf{MP}}_0(\pi) \leqslant c \land \underline{\mathbf{MP}}_1(\pi) > d-\epsilon \}
\end{equation*}
We say that a vertex $v$ is $(c,d)^{\epsilon}$-bad if $(c,d) \in \Lambda^{\epsilon}(v)$. Let $c' \in \mathbb{R}$. A play $\pi$ in G is called a $(c',d)^{\epsilon}$-witness of $\mathbf{ASV}^{\epsilon}(v) > c$ if it starts from $v$, and $(\underline{\mathbf{MP}}_0(\pi), \underline{\mathbf{MP}}_1(\pi)) = (c', d)$ where $c' > c$, and $\pi$ does not contain any $(c,d)^{\epsilon}$-bad vertex. A play $\pi$ is called an $\epsilon$-witness of $\mathbf{ASV}^{\epsilon}(v) > c$ if it is a $(c',d)^{\epsilon}$-witness of $\mathbf{ASV}^{\epsilon}(v) > c$ for some $c',d$. 
The following theorem justifies the name witness.

\sgcomment{We should state the difficulty in our case compared to \cite{FGR20}.}
A similar result has been established in \cite{FGR20} where the authors show that $\mathbf{ASV}(v) > c$ if and only if there exists a witness for $\mathbf{ASV}(v) > c$. However, proving that if $\mathbf{ASV}(v) > c$, then there exists an $\epsilon$-witness for $\mathbf{ASV}(v) > c$ requires a different proof technique, and is much more challenging in our case.

Now, we establish \textbf{NP}-membership for the threshold problem of determining if $\mathbf{ASV}^{\epsilon}(v) > c$. Towards this, we first prove the following lemma.

\input{ExpressionOfWitnessForASVEpsilon}

Now, we state the following theorem that establishes the $\mathbf{NP}$-membership of $\mathbf{ASV}^{\epsilon}(v) > c$.
