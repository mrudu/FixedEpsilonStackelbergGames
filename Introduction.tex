We write here about 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Stackelberg games including history (Refer to 1934 paper by Stackelberg); comparison with Nash equilibrium and state that Stackelberg strategy may produce greater payoff for the leader than in the Nash equilibrium.
    \item application of Stackelberg games
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{{\bf Related Work}} We should look at the following papers:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Dana Fisman, Orna Kupferman, and Yoad Lustig. Rational synthesis. (Even these papers possibly talk about the cooperative setting, and not the adversarial setting.)

\paragraph{{\bf Our contribution}} This should also include comparison with \cite{FGR20} in more details.

\paragraph{{\bf Organization of the paper}} Here we should talk about the sections in sequence, and one sentence for what each section is about.
