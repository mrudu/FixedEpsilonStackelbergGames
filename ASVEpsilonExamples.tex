In this section, we start the study of mean-payoff games by displaying some constraints on the memory required to achieve $\mathbf{ASV}^{\epsilon}$ value.

First we show that there exist mean-payoff games $\mathcal{G}$ and vertex $v_0$ in $\mathcal{G}$ such that $\mathbf{ASV}^{\epsilon}(v_0)$ can be achieved using infinite memory strategy for Player $0$, and also there exist mean-payoff games $\mathcal{G}$ with vertex $v_0$ such that $\mathbf{ASV}^{\epsilon}(v_0)$ can be achieved using finite memory (but not memoryless) strategy for Player $0$.

\input{inf_memory_example}

The following example shows the existence of mean-payoff games in which Player $0$ can achieve the adversarial value with finite memory (but not memoryless) strategies.

Further, we can also show that for a given strategy $\sigma_0$ of Player $0$, and for a given $\epsilon > 0$, there may not exist a finite memory strategy of Player $1$ that is an $\epsilon$-optimal response to $\sigma_0$.
